"As an English language taker, I always admire the grandeurs of delving myself thoroughly into the world of English language, specifically grammar. In connection, I am inclined to believe that it is more necessary to study profoundly the English grammar (e.i. prescriptive, descriptive, etc.) than practicing conversation skills (both are important, but one weighs greater than the other). First, not all talks are conversational, some are oratorical and the like, it means, that having the knowledge on how and what grammar to use is important at all cost and case to preserve formality and interest with the person(s) involved. Second, to avoid miscommunication, misinterpretation, and interferences (physical, visual, audio, etc.) because numerous reports have been tackled due to the mentioned issues that might be grammar issues were one of the reasons. Lastly, in this oblique spheroid world, especially today where the advent of technologies keep on innovating which resulted of everything must be done virtually, thus a person's academic knowledge of grammar (learned and acquired) can be a helpful tool to reconnect and recalibrate the beauty of its possession, life, and communication.",0
studying grammar is way necessary because it is also a way practice english formally ,1
Because grammar is the foundation of an effective communication. It is our blueprint of what are the rules that will help us communicate effectively. ,1
I disagree that it is more necessary  to study grammar than practice conversation skills  it is because conversational  skill is more important to develop the well being of people.,0
"Grammar is crucial in terms of communicating with one another. Therefore, individuals need to study and comprehend the proper and basic usage of a grammar with regard to their construction of statements all throughout the communication process, before practicing conversation skills. In addition to that, if an individual lack knowledge about how to construct a sentence properly his/her message towards the receiver of the message would be meaningless or it can be even misleading. Hence, grammar is more significant to learn than practicing conversation skills, for even more clear, concise, and organize communication. ",1
Studying grammar and practicing conversation skills are both necessary and essential most especially if you're becoming a language teacher.  They are like twins that don't need separation or unequal attention.,0
"I am with all confidence that studying grammar is more necessary than practicing conversation skills to be an eloquent speaker when it comes to communicating through the English medium. We need a strong foundation to conversate effectively and wisdom about grammar because practicing conversation skills can be made after we are acquainted or getting familiar with the system of the English language which is grammar. I believe that having a good command of the English language will make learning conversation skills a lot easier. Besides, conversation skills can be acquired easily but knowledge in grammar takes an adequate time of researching. ",1
"When practicing grammar we also practicing our conversation skills. Conversation skills is continuously improve by righting and practicing our grammars, like correcting mistakes on our grammars we also tend to make it proper and more ethical way.",1
"Studying grammar is more important than to practice conversation skills in two reasons. First, grammar help every individual to convey their ideas or speech in a right way where everyone can clearly understand what they are trying to say. Second, learning grammar build the confidence of an individual in every conversation. Having a skills in conversation is useless when your ideas is vague and pointless. I believe that a person who knows the right way of using punctuations, words, and everything related to grammar can make a clear and enhance conversation skills.",1
"I agree that it is more necessary to study grammar than to practice conversation skills because we must know first the correct use of words before we talk or have a conversation with someone grammar can help us to become articulate or better communicator it is the key to speaking, writing or reading English.",1
"Studying grammar is very important because grammar helps us to communicate better without any misunderstanding. I believe that while learning grammar you are also practicing your conversation skills. While learning grammar you can practice you conversation skills in 2 ways, through written conversation or verbal conversation. ",1
"I strongly agree to the idea that it is more necessary to study grammar rather than practicing conversation skills because it help us speak proper sentences. Studying grammar can help us to have a better conversation skills. Also we need to study grammar because it serves as a strong foundation of a good communication, to easily understand and comprehend a thought or message. ",1
"I agree that one should study grammar, it should be studied well so we'll have an effective conversational skills.",1
"The English language was considered as the universal language thus, it helps us to communicate with other people with diverse cultures, ethnicity, and language. Indeed, studying correct use of grammar is necessary to better understand each other. This will help us to communicate effectively and efficiently. However, practicing conversation skill is also important just as using proper grammar, for the speaker to look confident and persuasive. These two are both crucial in communicating but in my point of view, studying grammar is more necessary. ",1
"Both are necessary, but then in my point of view if you don't practice spoken communication, it will be very difficult for you to improve your conversation skills no matter how much grammar and vocabulary you study. 
If you practice copying the words and phrases you hear from other speakers, you'll be able to write and speak in a new language with fluency. As long as you are conversing with people you can relate to and with whom you have information on a certain subject, it is OK. When you go to a job interview, for instance, the interviewer won't look at your grammar; instead, it will be the manner in which you speak, convey your message, and engage with the interviewer that will convince him or her that you are qualified for the position. It's not required to learn grammar in order to making this happen. Grammar just makes the rules you are learning through listening more clear.",0
"I disagree with that question. I know that grammar is an important aspect of communication, but practicing conversation skills is way more crucial in developing the fluency in a language we are trying to learn.",0
"I strongly disagree, why? Because for me, grammar can be learned through our daily conversation, since we are practicing speaking with other and exchange necessary information, also to build confidence.",0
"For me, I think grammar is just one part of the process of learning a language. Focusing solely on learning the grammar can hinder your progress in other parts or areas of your life.",0
"Without a good foundation in understanding the grammar, more likely, our conversation skills will be just limited or restricted and will eventually ineffective.",1
Having a proper grammar is important to have a clear communication. It should be the priority  of learning the language.,1
"I disagree because we need this type of duo, the grammar and communication skills each of them has important role to create a good communication.",0
"No, although I believe that learning grammar is important, I also believe practicing conversation skills is more important due to the fact that learning conversation skills lets you connect more with your audience. Also, even though your grammar is correct, if you do not communicate with your audience, it is considered useless as you did not communicate the intended message to your audience",0
"I agree since we focus more on writing in school, and grammar helps us speak appropriate sentences, which improves our conversation skills. Also studying grammar can prevent misinterpretation.",1
"I'm not sure but, I think there is a need for us to study grammar than to practice conversation skills. Let's take this for example, how can we expeess or convey our thoughts if we can't speak properly since we are not so knowledgeable with grammar composition.",1
"I agree, studying grammar can be a tool for us to learn the language and by that we can effectively share our opinion or the like. I'm agreeing because it's a way for us to learn how communication works in an effective and probable way of exchanging information.",1
"I agree with that statement because there is learning while practicing conversational skill. We can learn the language such as grammar because we can exchange information that can help us build our foundation. Another reason is that, in practicing conversational skill we can learn empathy with other people.",0
"Needless to say, self-practice or learning Grammar is a must since it plays an important role in learning. We need to prepare ourself first before we happen to talk with others.

The more you practice, the more comfortable you’ll feel when using the language. Just like your mother tongue, you were born with it, so speaking isn’t a big issue for you.",1
"I did disagree, ​I mean focus on fluency, instead of grammar. Some experts even say we don’t need to study grammar in order to be able to speak English fluently.",0
"I am against with the question above since grammar is just an aspect of English. There are other things, which are much more important in speaking. Focusing too much on grammar stops us from opening our mouth to speak. The fear of losing face makes us nervous when it comes to speaking.",0
For me grammar is just a norm in the world of language. We will not learn by just eyeing ourselves with learning or studying grammar. We also need to have a real life interaction to further improve ourselves.,0
Yes it does. You don't need to learn things in detail but a basic understanding is needed to be a better speaker.,1
"Well, its not important at all, please stop focusing on the grammer because most native English speakers don't know what a past participle is, for example. But they use them correctly because they learned by repeating how other people spoke. You can do the same.

You can learn by listening to native English speakers or non-native speakers with a good level. Then, use the phrases you hear and observe the reaction. Did people understand what you said? Did you get the reaction yo u wanted? If so, you are on the right track. Keep using t hat phrase! Of course, if it's interesting for you to learn. details about grammar, go ahead! But, don't think that i t's necessary to study grammar to speak English well. I t's not. Millions of people spend years and years studying grammar in school only to realize that they can't have a decent conversation. If you want to be able to speak to people in English, make sure that is how you learn-b y speaking to people. Not by studying grammar,",0
Both are important. If you are learning spoken English grammer plays a supporting role but when you are going through English Writing grammer plays an important role in it. So I suggest everyone to study both equally.,1
It is other way round.It is more important to learn conversational skills than grammar because grammatical mistakes can be tolerated whereas if you make mistake while communicating that makes the worst impression on the listener.,0
In my perception you will not get the essence of english language without knowing grammar. Grammar is like a set of protocols that you have to follow while writing and speaking english but one cannot assure you that knowing grammar will make you better in spoken English.,1
Grammar is the base of english. If you know the right Grammar your english will be fluent. Bad Grammar affects the writing skills and communication base both. Before jump into communication try to strong your Grammar base which is very important.,1
"Both things are important. First you should start speaking in English. No one is that much fluent when one starts speaking English for the first time. But if you try on speaking and went on going correcting yourself wherever necessary, believe me you will be definitely get success.",0
Grammar and spoken language go hand in hand. You can't do much just by learning grammar nor can you talk without errors without understanding grammar.,1
"Grammar is the most fundamental element of any language, be it English or any other Language. Conversation skill can only be correct if you have the proper grammar skill. Because when you speak wrong ENGLISH then you get insulted by others who speak the correct one.",1
"Of course, Grammar is more important than conversation skills. What's the use of a conversation if the other cannot completely understand you? Grammar completes the meaning of your speech.",1
Grammar is the subject that people should learn and understand it. Grammar helps us to know the situation that what kind of grammars do they use? And it can also help people get more understanding by using correct grammar in speaking. When you have a good grammar skill then u will have a beauty conversation.,1
"Grammar is important than the communication skills because it is the language that makes it possible for us to talk about language. by Grammar you are write names the different of words, and you make sentences, so you can use your grammar skills when you are want communicate, if you Know grammar, your speech will be very obvious, and you will follow by the structure. We all know how to build a sentence, but we do not know how to build a beauty sentence so for this we need to learn by grammar. And knowing about grammar offers a window into the human mind and into our amazingly complex mental capacity.",1
"In my point of view, it is more important to be good at speaking than writing, because the ability to speakskillfully provides the speaker with several good advantages such as: ability to inform, persuade and direct, ability to have a confidence in unknown society, and also to have a good relatiopns with others. Nowadays to speak well is essential for social communication. There is a typical example of me, I am really good at grammar, because at school i had a perfect teacher, who always taught us english grammars, however i never had a practice of speking. I was poor at speaking, i couldn't explain my thoughts, opinions. But now i study at the university, where all subjects, lessons are in English. And i had foundation courses, where i improved my speaking skills by doing presentations, discussions and performances. So, i can say that grammar is important, but speaking is more significant than writing. In addition, to speak well is the key to beating in the competition, especially for getting a job, because while being an interview you will have a huge confidence in yourself, and confidence is the best key of everything))).",0
"Grammar should be studied more than the conversation skills. Im not saying that it is more important, but we should focus more on it. Because, with good grammar skills, comes good conversation skills. I dont think you'd be able to communicate with other people very much if you have no idea of the language that you are talking in. For example, you dont have any background in the English language, then how would you even know how to speak with it?",1
"We dont need practice in grammar, once we know how to use grammer words, we dont need practice it every day, as i dont need it..i use english when it is need, and it is complimentary from my seniors.i dont think practicing skill is more important than grammer, because..practicing skill just messed up english language..in todays world no one is writing or practicing english grammatically, every they just use short form, if no grammer, no proper english, what will it happen, studying skill is best when it is with grammer my dear fellow opponents and also, if we have lots of knowledge ,their is no need to practice, its about your sharp memory how much you can remember , and as you said experience id best policy , my experience says that we dont need practice , if we have knowledge and we are confident on what we have learned that wil forget or never fade from your mind..tere are lot of people who dont practice maths, but today also if somebody give them to solve ..they solve it with in a minute...that's what i have knowledge which i dont need practicing........my confidence is my practice and my experience is my mind.If you can't properly construct a sentence, how can you expect anyone to understand what you are attempting to convey? and what's the use of practicing grammar?there is a saying about grammar i like, may not be totally relevant but i'm going to share anyway.. grammar is the difference between helping your Uncle Jack, off a horse Well, considering you spelled ""Practicing"" wrong, I'd say yes. It amazes me, and not in a good way, how poorly people's grammar skills are. Most people can talk perfectly find, but when it comes to grammar they tend to not to do as well. So I would say it is definitely more important to study Grammar is important than the writing skills because it is the language that makes it possible for us to write and talk about language. by Grammar you can write names the different of words, and you make sentences, so you can use your grammar skills when you are want write , if you Know grammar, your speech will be very obvious, and you will follow by the structure. We all know how to build a sentence, but we do not know how to build a beauty sentence so for this we need to learn by grammar. And knowing about grammar offers a window into the human mind and into our amazingly complex mental capacity. But on practice he/she may do face some current situation and that time also he/she may not perform perfectly as required.Grammar skilled guy can go anywhere means any type communication - oral or written , face to face or behind, man to man or in a group, personal or corporate wherever it is the grammar skilled guy can face smoothly. But without it just face once or perform poorly.",0
"Pragmatically, conversation lessons and exercises are intended to improve conversational skills. For this reason, I find it helpful to first focus on building skills by eliminating some of the barriers that might be in the way of production. Having been assigned roles, opinions and points of view that they do not necessarily share, students are freed from having to express their own opinions. Therefore, they can focus on expressing themselves well in English. In this way, students tend to concentrate more on production skills, and less on factual content. They also are less likely to insist on literal translations from their mother tongue.",0
"Think about children, how they learn the language. They don't know how to read, therefore they don't study the grammar rules, and yet they learn to speak the language fast and fluent. Best to study English through listening and conversation practice first, then grammar later when you are in the advanced level.",0
"If you are a person with good conversation skills, you also naturally inspire others to do the same thing even without trying. Having good conversation skills is like shining a flashlight on what is otherwise considered as a typical work routine day.",0
"Most English learners feel that they need more conversation practice. In fact, over the years I've noticed that the number one requested skill by students is conversation practice. I think this points clearly to the fact that students need English to communicate first and foremost. Grammar, writing and other skills are all very important, but in the students' minds conversation is the most important. Unfortunately, teaching conversational skills is much more challenging that teaching grammar.",1
"Grammar is important than the communication skills because it is the language that makes it possible for us to talk about language. by Grammar you are write names the different of words, and you make sentences, so you can use your grammar skills when you are want communicate, if you Know grammar, your speech will be very obvious, and you will follow by the structure.

while someone practice grammar become more friendly & he make the maximum output of it. But on conversation he/she may do face some current situation and that time also he/she may not perform perfectly as required.

Grammar skilled guy can go anywhere means any type communication - oral or written , face to face or behind, man to man or in a group, personal or corporate wherever it is the grammar skilled guy can face smoothly. But without it just face once or perform poorly.

You have to know the structures and rules of the sentence first. If you know the structure of the sentences, you can speak fluently and nicer.

Conversation skills are important! ""Conversation skills are important to any kinds of career because it is the base means with which you express yourself to other people, specifically your colleagues, your boss and other people you will deal with in the career you have chosen for yourself. Many a competent graduate has missed out on opportunities for a rewarding career because he or she lacked the ample amount of conversation skills needed to be able to sustain the communication dynamics that come with every sort of promotion in work.

If you are a person with good conversation skills, you also naturally inspire others to do the same thing even without trying. Having good conversation skills is like shining a flashlight on what is otherwise considered as a typical work routine day.",0
"Yes, studying grammar is more important than practicing conservation skills because without knowing basic English grammar we cannot have a conversation happening between people.",1
"yes of course studying grammar is important than practising conversation skills.... And when will be able to practice conversation skills...??...
Only when u r perfect in grammar n vocabulary na.... And of course grammar is the base of English...only if ur grammar is developed u will be able to do conversation properly....",1
"Grammar should be studied more than the conversation skills.In my point of View we should focus more on it. Because, with good grammar skills, comes good conversation skills.",1
"The ability to communicate in a company is very important, even if it is verbal communication. Young children learn communication skills before they learn grammar.",0
"First of all, in real life, we need conversation skills more than grammar. You can live without knowledge of grammar, but not without communication. I think the only situation when people need grammar is in tests.",0
"You will not be able to speak well if you study grammar only. When you think too much of grammar, you will lose the chance to speak.",0
"Grammar provides the basic foundation, gives confidence when speaking.  Knowing the rules of grammar are more important in other languages (other than English) where there may be more rules and considerations.",1
"In a business environment, or in other specific areas, especially if you are writing correspondence etc., it is very important to have great grammar skills in order to be credible and professional",1
"Conversation skills are something that forms a connection between two people or more. It is the conveying of ideas and understanding the other person’s point of view.

Grammar is important but it only improves your hold on the language. Good Grammar is not Good Conversation Skills. Hence, I think that conversation skills are always more important.

Example, when an illiterate man speaks in Hindi to a tax officer, his grammar might not be perfect but he would be able to communicate his issue to him.
Or, if a politician (who studied in vernacular medium) gives a speech in English, his grammar may not be as good but still, if his speech is impactful, people would vote for him.",0
