"2023/04/21 6:54:36 PM GMT+8","Disagree","As an English language taker, I always admire the grandeurs of delving myself thoroughly into the world of English language, specifically grammar. In connection, I am inclined to believe that it is more necessary to study profoundly the English grammar (e.i. prescriptive, descriptive, etc.) than practicing conversation skills (both are important, but one weighs greater than the other). First, not all talks are conversational, some are oratorical and the like, it means, that having the knowledge on how and what grammar to use is important at all cost and case to preserve formality and interest with the person(s) involved. Second, to avoid miscommunication, misinterpretation, and interferences (physical, visual, audio, etc.) because numerous reports have been tackled due to the mentioned issues that might be grammar issues were one of the reasons. Lastly, in this oblique spheroid world, especially today where the advent of technologies keep on innovating which resulted of everything must be done virtually, thus a person's academic knowledge of grammar (learned and acquired) can be a helpful tool to reconnect and recalibrate the beauty of its possession, life, and communication."

Therefore, individuals need to study and comprehend the proper and basic usage of a grammar with regard to their construction of statements all throughout the communication process, before practicing conversation skills. In addition to that, if an individual lack knowledge about how to construct a sentence properly his/her message towards the receiver of the message would be meaningless or it can be even misleading. Hence, grammar is more significant to learn than practicing conversation skills, for even more clear, concise, and organize communication. "

"2023/04/21 7:21:50 PM GMT+8","Agree","I am with all confidence that studying grammar is more necessary than practicing conversation skills to be an eloquent speaker when it comes to communicating through the English medium. We need a strong foundation to conversate effectively and wisdom about grammar because practicing conversation skills can be made after we are acquainted or getting familiar with the system of the English language which is grammar. I believe that having a good command of the English language will make learning conversation skills a lot easier. Besides, conversation skills can be acquired easily but knowledge in grammar takes an adequate time of researching. "

"2023/04/21 7:38:38 PM GMT+8","Agree","Studying grammar is more important than to practice conversation skills in two reasons. First, grammar help every individual to convey their ideas or speech in a right way where everyone can clearly understand what they are trying to say. Second, learning grammar build the confidence of an individual in every conversation. Having a skills in conversation is useless when your ideas is vague and pointless.

Indeed, studying correct use of grammar is necessary to better understand each other. This will help us to communicate effectively and efficiently. However, practicing conversation skill is also important just as using proper grammar, for the speaker to look confident and persuasive. These two are both crucial in communicating but in my point of view, studying grammar is more necessary. "
"2023/04/23 8:10:12 AM GMT+8","Disagree","Both are necessary, but then in my point of view if you don't practice spoken communication, it will be very difficult for you to improve your conversation skills no matter how much grammar and vocabulary you study. 
If you practice copying the words and phrases you hear from other speakers, you'll be able to write and speak in a new language with fluency. As long as you are conversing with people you can relate to and with whom you have information on a certain subject, it is OK. When you go to a job interview, for instance, the interviewer won't look at your grammar; instead, it will be the manner in which you speak, convey your message, and engage with the interviewer that will convince him or her that you are qualified for the position. It's not required to learn grammar in order to making this happen. Grammar just makes the rules you are learning through listening more clear."
"2023/04/23 8:16:07 PM GMT+8","Disagree","I disagree with that question. I know that grammar is an important aspect of communication, but practicing conversation skills is way more crucial in developing the fluency in a language we are trying to learn."
"2023/04/23 8:16:28 PM GMT+8","Disagree","I strongly disagree, why? Because for me, grammar can be learned through our daily conversation, since we are practicing speaking with other and exchange necessary information, also to build confidence."
"2023/04/23 8:16:47 PM GMT+8","Disagree","For me, I think grammar is just one part of the process of learning a language. Focusing solely on learning the grammar can hinder your progress in other parts or areas of your life."
"2023/04/23 8:17:12 PM GMT+8","Agree","Without a good foundation in understanding the grammar, more likely, our conversation skills will be just limited or restricted and will eventually ineffective."
"2023/04/23 8:17:30 PM GMT+8","Agree","Having a proper grammar is important to have a clear communication. It should be the priority  of learning the language."
"2023/04/23 8:22:48 PM GMT+8","Disagree","I disagree because we need this type of duo, the grammar and communication skills each of them has important role to create a good communication."
"2023/04/23 8:42:25 PM GMT+8","Disagree","No, although I believe that learning grammar is important, I also believe practicing conversation skills is more important due to the fact that learning conversation skills lets you connect more with your audience. Also, even though your grammar is correct, if you do not communicate with your audience, it is considered useless as you did not communicate the intended message to your audience"
"2023/04/23 8:44:11 PM GMT+8","Agree","I agree since we focus more on writing in school, and grammar helps us speak appropriate sentences, which improves our conversation skills. Also studying grammar can prevent misinterpretation."
"2023/04/23 11:13:56 PM GMT+8","Agree","I'm not sure but, I think there is a need for us to study grammar than to practice conversation skills.

"2023/04/23 11:18:24 PM GMT+8","Disagree","I agree with that statement because there is learning while practicing conversational skill. We can learn the language such as grammar because we can exchange information that can help us build our foundation. Another reason is that, in practicing conversational skill we can learn empathy with other people."
"2023/04/23 11:24:07 PM GMT+8","Agree","Needless to say, self-practice or learning Grammar is a must since it plays an important role in learning. We need to prepare ourself first before we happen to talk with others.

The more you practice, the more comfortable you’ll feel when using the language. Just like your mother tongue, you were born with it, so speaking isn’t a big issue for you."
"2023/04/23 11:27:00 PM GMT+8","Disagree","I did disagree, ​I mean focus on fluency, instead of grammar. Some experts even say we don’t need to study grammar in order to be able to speak English fluently."
"2023/04/23 11:29:15 PM GMT+8","Disagree","I am against with the question above since grammar is just an aspect of English. There are other things, which are much more important in speaking. Focusing too much on grammar stops us from opening our mouth to speak. The fear of losing face makes us nervous when it comes to speaking."
"2023/04/23 11:32:13 PM GMT+8","Disagree","For me grammar is just a norm in the world of language. We will not learn by just eyeing ourselves with learning or studying grammar. We also need to have a real life interaction to further improve ourselves."
